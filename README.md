# COVID-19-DATA-TRACKER
    
    Project Description:   
The goal of this project was to implement a COVID-19 (2019 - CoronaVirus) statistics tracker. This application allows users to fetch real-time statistics conerning the # confirmed, active, recovered and deaths for 6 individual countries. The user also has the ability to view statistics for the world as a whole. We have also chosen to show individual statistics for Canada's 13 provinces and territories. This application also allows for visual graph trends that showcase COVID-19 statistics over a few months time. 

**Sample Output for Canada:**

    Key Concepts:
This project focuses heavily on API fetching, to retrieve and update information. We have also chosen to store the data locally on the user's machine whilst they execute the application. In addition, we utilized the matplotlib library to visualize the data into a graph format. Then, the tkinter module was utilized to create the Graphical User Interface.
