    Project Description:
The goal with this project was to implement a live COVID-19 (Coronavirus) statistics tracker. The user has the ability to view statistics for worldwide, and/or specific stats for a given country. Currently, the solution is only implemented for 6 selected countries, but more countries will be added in the near future, or as demand requires. 

This Python script allows users to display live up to date information right on their desktop. We utilized key concepts such as json parsing, the tkinter, and matplotlib libraries. We will allow the user to see information for today's date, and view a graphical depiction of the last month's COVID-19 trend. Displaying information is one aspect, but analyzing trends is another goal with this project. In addition, the applicaiton will have additional features such as: Live vaccine updates, news relating to COVID-19 worldwide, and relevant stock data for companies that are on the front-lines of fighting the virus. 

Currently we have a discord server setup for the team working on the project. All communication is conducted through that server. If you wish to participate in the development of this project, please get in contact with me to be added to the team.
